A simple Miso Soup recipe. It's easier than you think!
##Ingredients
> * 3 cups water
> * 1/4 cup chopped green onion
> * 1/4 cup firm silk tofu, cut into tiny cubes
> * 2 Tbsp red miso paste
> *  2x2 inch piece of Kombu (Dried Kelp)
> *  1/2 cup bonito flakes
> * 1 sheet nori cut into large rectangles // 1 sheet yields 1/4 cup

----------
## Directions
1. Make the __dashi__. Combine the water and kombu in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove the kombu just as the water starts to come to a boil. Add the bonito flakes and let the water come to a **simmer for one minute**. Remove from heat and let steep for **five minutes**. Strain the bonito from the dashi.

2.  Mix a small amount of dashi with the miso in a bowl. Whisk so the miso dissolves, then combine with the remaining dashi in the saucepan.

3. Taste the soup. If it is too salty, add water and return to simmer.

2. Return soup to a simmer, then add tofu and scallions.

Enjoy!
